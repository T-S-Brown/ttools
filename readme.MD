### A collection of personal R functions

This repository contains an R package egotistically called ttools. There is no intention for this to be released on CRAN, rather its functionality is a space for personal functions to make development and production simpler in R. 

The key advantage of these is that all functions revolve around the theme of rapid prototyping.
